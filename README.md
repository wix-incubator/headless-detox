# Headless Detox (Detox Headless Driver)

## Nothing to see here (yet)

This project aims to provide a headless driver for the Detox end-to-end (E2E) testing framework developed by Wix. The driver enables running Detox tests in a headless environment, without the need for a device.

**Note:** This project is currently a work in progress. Stay tuned for updates and exciting developments!
