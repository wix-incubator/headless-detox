## Nothing to see here (yet)

This project aims to provide a headless driver for the Detox end-to-end (E2E) testing framework developed by Wix. The driver enables running Detox tests in a headless environment, without the need for a device.

**Note:** This project is currently a work in progress.

For more information about Detox and its official repository, please visit [wix/detox](https://github.com/wix/detox).

## Looking for Contributors

I am actively seeking contributors to help me build the Detox Headless Driver. If you would like to contribute to this project, please get in touch with me (Asaf Korem), at [asafk@wix.com](mailto:asafk@wix.com).
